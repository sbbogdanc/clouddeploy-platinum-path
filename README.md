# clouddeploy-platinum-path

This repo tries to demo a few applications (under `apps/`) and it's path to
deployment via Google Cloud Platform's `Cloud Build` + `Cloud Deploy`.
Since a lot of setup is needed, I took inspiration from `willisc7` Golden Path
repo (see below).

I've tried to simplify the app and the `skaffold` part and concentrated on
automating the installation of Service Accounts, clusters, etc. all in
single scripts with a catchy name.

Note that EVERYTHING is automated except linking the external repo to Cloud
Build (talked to the PM, this is currently possible in alpha API and it's
among my TODOs).

## Install

* Create a project and assign billing to it. There gonna be clusterz :/
* `cp .env.sh.dist .env.sh`
* Edit away with your personal project ids.
* `sh 00-init.sh` and so on.. for all steps.

You should be good to go!

For more shenaningans you might need to install `lolcat` (`gem install lolcat`) as
it colors my life and most likely yours too. If you insist on a gray life, just
rename lolcat to cat :) Other scripts can all be found in my Swiss-Army Knife repo:

## The apps

The app part is really the NON-interesting part here. I tried to keep it as simple as
possible. You can complicate it as long as you have a Dockerfile or a Buildpack
to build it.

* `apps/app01/` This is a sample Python app. 
* `apps/app02/` This is a sample Ruby app. 

They both expose a single Web page (`/`) with a lot of debug useful information, usually 
surfaced by proper ENV vars.

## Build philosophy

* Every commit to TRUNK will trigger a Cloud Build, no matter what. In particular, any
change to the code to app01 will trigger a build in the APP01 pipeline, and same for App02.
Yes, it's that beautiful.
* Promotion DEV -> STAGING. This is a second BUILD which also executes `make test` in the 
`app/MYAPP` folder.

## Deploy philosophy

4 targets have been created:

## Credits

* willisc7 for https://github.com/willisc7/next21-demo-golden-path and the
   inspiring `demo-startup.sh`.
* dmarzi@ for incredible help on GKE manifests.
* Alex Bielski for his support in getting a `Cloud Build` to work with multiple
  Skaffold modules, plus Skaffold *caching*.
